## Create your own CFNGoat fork on Github

Since CFNGoat is already hosted on github, lets create our own fork so we can make changes and integrate our automated pipeline.

Visit the CFNGoat repo at [(https://github.com/bridgecrewio/cfngoat)](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/cfngoat)

Login to `github.com` if you are not already authenticated, and click the `Fork` button for the CFNGoat repository.

If you have multiple organisations, github will ask which of your orgs to fork into, chose your personal account (your username in the list) to fork the repo.

You'll then be redirected to your own fork, notice your username at the top of the page:
