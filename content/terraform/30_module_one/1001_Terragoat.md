## Vulnerable-by-design demo repository setup

This workshop uses our vulnerable-by-design Terraform project, TerraGoat, so that you can scan and automate infrastructure code without the added friction of integrating your own code. Simply clone the open-source projectâ€™s repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat.git
cd terragoat
git status
```

Sample output

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat.git
cd terragoat
git status
