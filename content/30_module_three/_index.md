# Fixing issues quickly with security-as-code to improve your cloud security posture

As weâ€™ve shown so far, Bridgecrew provides the policies and workflow to audit your CloudFormation templates before deployment, and optionally to block vulnerabilities making it to your deployment pipeline.

However **two questions still remain!**

### Question One
-   What about fixing the descovered issues in an automated, auditable fashion.

### Question Two
-   What about infrastructure that's already running, and maybe wasn't deployed via Infrastructure as Code?  

In this module, we'll look to solve both of these, by Integrating Github automated pull requests, and runtime scanning of your AWS account!


### Module Learning Objectives
- Enable runtime security scanning of your AWS account with Bridgecrew
- Automating fixes through remediation Pull Requests and Github
- Gain insights against compliance benchmarks
- Use the bridgecrew dashboard to monitor cloud security posture over time
