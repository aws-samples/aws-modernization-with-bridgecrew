## Fork the TerraGoat repository on GitHub

To set up your demo environment, you can push your local clone of TerraGoat or fork the repository. Weâ€™re doing the second option.

Head over to the TerraGoat repository at [https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat). Fork the code using the button in the upper right corner.

If you have multiple organizations, GitHub will ask which of your orgs to fork into. Choose your personal account via your username in the list to fork the repo.
