Before you get started, we will check the workshop pre-requisites.


The workshop environment will drop you into an example development team, at the start of their journey through the DevSecOps world!

They already use ‘Infrastructure as Code’ to define their environments, and the deployment target is a Kubernetes cluster, which is also setup.

To get the most out of this tutorial, it will also be helpful to have a basic understanding of git, Kubernetes, AWS core concepts (IAM, regions, UI, CLI, APIs), and CI/CD principles.

Next we'll ensure we have all the items needed:

- An AWS account to run the workshop (provided via AWS Event Engine)
- A Bridgecrew Account
- A GitHub Account
- The Automation to setup our Kubernetes, CI/CD and workshop scenarios
